\usage{
grr_calc(data, part, operator, meas, LSL = NULL, USL = NULL, method = "anova")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An R dataframe or tibble containing the required identifier and measurement columns.}

\item{part}{A string giving the column name specifying the unique ID of the part being measured. The column
should be a character or factor.}

\item{operator}{A string giving the column name specifying the operator for the recorded measurement. The column
should be a character or factor.}

\item{meas}{A string giving the column name where the measurement value is recorded. The column must be numeric and
contain no missing or infinite values.}

\item{LSL}{A number specifying the lower specification limit.}

\item{USL}{A number specifying the upper specification limit.}

\item{method}{A string specifying "anova" or "xbar_r".  The ANOVA method fits a mixed-effects
model and permits unequal replicate counts per operator/part combination (each combination still
requires at least two measurements).  The average/range method continues to require a balanced
design with an equal number of replicates for every combination.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item VarianceComponents: Data frame of variance components and percent contribution
\item GageEval: Data frame of study variation metrics
\item AnovaTable: ANOVA table (if method = "anova")
}
